Pool Boiling Module
===================
.. role:: red

The functions are specific to data generated within our lab pool boiling setup. They are used to prepare data in the csv form required to training and testing

**function** :red:`PrepareHydrophone(...)`

    Parameters:
        * tempfilepath: path to labview generated temperature file
        * soundfilepath: path to labview generated hydrophone data file
        * savepath: path to save data
        * extracttime: boolean specifying whether to find the start time of the data from the labview files, do not use if start time in file is wrong (defaults to True)
        * tempstart: time in seconds of when the temperature readings started, not needed if extracting time (defaults to None)
        * soundstart: time in seconds of when the hydrophone readings started, not needed if extracting time (defaults to None)

    Outputs:
        * Saves csv with time, hydrophone data, and heat flux

**function** :red:`PrepareAE(...)`

    Parameters:
        * aedata: path to saved AEWin summary data
        * aewaveforms: path to folder containing saved ae waveforms
        * tempfilepath: path to labview generated temperature file
        * output: path to folder where data should be saved
        * name: unique extension for the saved data corresponding to the experiment
        * extracttime: boolean specifying whether to find the start time from the files (defaults to True)
        * aestart: time in seconds of when the ae sensor starts reading, not needed if extracting time (defaults to None)
        * tempstart: time in seconds of when the temperature readings start, not needed if extracting time (defaults to None)

    Outputs:
        * a csv file containing time and correpsonding heat flux and path to ae waveform txt files.
        * txt files with all ae waveforms

**function** :red:`PrepareImages(...)`

    Parameters:
        * imagepathfolder: path to location of folder containing images in .jpg format
        * tempfilepath: path to temperature file generated by labview
        * savepath: location to save csv data
        * framerate: amount of frames per second of camera
        * vidstart: time in seconds of when the video started
        * extracttime: boolean specifying whether to extract the start time from the temperature file

    Outputs:
        * a csv file containing time, paths to images, and corresponding heat flux

**function** :red:`PreparePCAImages(...)`

    Parameters:
        * pcamodelpath: location to saved PCA model
        * imagecsvfile: path to csv file generated using the PrepareImages function
        * imgw: image width in pixels to resize image
        * imgh: image height in pixels to resize image
        * pcas: number of pcs the model converts images to

    Outputs:
        * saves images converted to pcs to np file with the same name as the csv file
